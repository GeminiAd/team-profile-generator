### Add a Team Manager

When you start the program, you will prompted for information about the team manager:                             
![Team Manager Prompt](./images/team-manager-prompt.png)                        

NOTE: If at any time you enter invalid information for an employee, an error message is displayed and you won't be able to continue until you enter a valid value:                                
![Error Displayed in Prompt](./images/prompt-error.png)                     

When you successfully enter information for the team manager, you have the option to add another team member:

### Add an Engineer

If you select add "Add an Engineer", you will be prompted to enter information about the engineer:                 
![Add an Engineer Prompt](./images/add-engineer-prompt.png)                                        

And then you're prompted to add another team member:               
![Add Another Team Member Prompt](./images/add-another-team-member-prompt.png)                        

### Add an Intern

If you select add "Add an Intern", you will be prompted to enter information about the intern:                 
![Add an Intern Prompt](./images/add-intern-prompt.png)             

And then you're prompted to add another team member:               
![Add Another Team Member Prompt](./images/add-another-team-member-prompt.png)                        

### Finish Building My Team

If you select "Finish building my team", the program will end and a website is generated representing the team profile of the team that you entered.         
 
NOTE: No matter the order that you add engineers and interns, the team profile will always show the manager first, then the engineers, and finally the interns, because who cares about interns? They're just going to accept the first paid position they're offered anyways.                   

The following shows the website generated for the above examples, plus an engineer named Alex, an engineer named Grace, and an intern named John:
